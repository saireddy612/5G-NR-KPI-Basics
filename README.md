# 5G NR KPI vs Throughput Analysis (Near / Mid / Far Cell)

This project analyses the relationship between critical 5G NR KPIs and downlink throughput across Near, Mid, and Far cell conditions. The objective is to understand how RF quality and link reliability influence user-plane performance in a controlled test environment.

## Cell Range Definition

Cell conditions are classified using SS-RSRP thresholds:

- **Near Cell:** SS-RSRP ≥ −75 dBm  
- **Mid Cell:** SS-RSRP between −95 dBm and −98 dBm  
- **Far Cell:** SS-RSRP between −108 dBm and −110 dBm  

These ranges are used consistently across all visualisations and comparisons.

## KPIs Analysed

- **SS-RSRP:** Signal strength and coverage indicator  
- **SS-SINR:** Signal quality and interference indicator  
- **DL BLER:** Downlink block error rate, indicating link reliability  
- **DL MCS:** Downlink modulation and coding scheme (spectral efficiency)  
- **DL Throughput:** User-plane downlink data rate (performance metric)
